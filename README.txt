Hello, thanks for spending the time to get to know my (well not really) code. For the time being
I am using a template that I just editted for my website. You can find the teplate here:

Special shoutout out to bootstrap for providing the template :).
If you like to view bootstrap's README, you can find it under README2.txt.

Thanks for stopping by,
Mitch
